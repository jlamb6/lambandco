                                    Before I found my passion in real estate, I dropped out of the 3rd university I attended on my 5th major.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                    After reading some books about real estate I fell in love. It combined my desire to have a flexible job, meet new people, and be around homes all the time. 
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                    You see my biggest dream is to be a mom. However, I knew I would still want to work and be able to provide for my family along side of my husband.                                        
                                <br/><br/>
                                    Real estate provides a way for me to work in an industry I love and have a little more flexibility than a normal office job.
